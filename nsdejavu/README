This is the main directory for X11/UNIX DjVu browser plugin. It is not enough
to compile this module to obtain a fully functioning plugin.  You also need to
compile the standalone DjVu viewer 'djview' using the X11 version of Qt4. This
does not work on the Mac unless you use a X11-based browser.  The stock Safari
and all downloadable builds of popular browsers for OS X are Cocoa-based.

TODO: Write a Cocoa-based browser plugin (see directory npdjvu.)
