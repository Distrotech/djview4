This directory contains mac specific tools.

* Directory "mdimporter_src" contains the source code of the DjVu
  spotlight plugin contributed by Jeff Sickel years ago. The resulting
  binary module must be inserted into the template bundle
  "skel/Library/Spotlight/DjVu.mdimporter".

* Directory "qlgenerator_src" contains the source code of the DjVu
  quicklook plugin contributed by Jeff Sickel years ago. The resulting
  binary module must be inserted into the template bundle
  "skel/Library/QuickLook/DjVu.qlgenerator".  This code depends on the
  presence of the "ddjvu" executable in the DjView application bundle.

* Shell script "make_djview_bundle.sh" creates a djview application
  bundle by taking the bundle template "skel", inserting the
  executable compiled in directory "src", adding the spotlight and
  quicklook plugins, adding a copy of the djvulibre command line tools
  and supporting files, and copying all the required Qt and Homebrew
  libraries. The final step patches all these executables and
  libraries in order to let them find each other without relying on
  anything not found in the bundle.

* Shell script "make_djview_dmg.sh" creates a disk image suitable
  for binary distribution.
