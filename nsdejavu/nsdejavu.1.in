.SH NAME
nsdejavu \- DjVu browser plugin

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B LIBDIR/netscape/plugins/NSDEJAVUSO

.SH DESCRIPTION
The shared library
.B NSDEJAVUSO
uses the Netscape browser plugin
.SM API
to display DjVu images in
in a number of popular web browsers.
Different web browsers provide various level
of support for Netscape plugins.
Please check section "Browser Compatibility"
for instructions on how to enable the
DjVu browser plugin.

The DjVuLibre browser plugin works by invoking
a standalone viewer with the special command line option
.BR -netscape .
The plugin first searches a program named
.BR djview .
If this program cannot be found,
it searches for
.BR djview4
and finally
.BR djview3.
It is always possible to override this search strategy
by setting the environment variable
.B NPX_DJVIEW
to the full path of the desired executable.


.SH MIME TYPES AND EXTENSIONS
Typing the
.SM URL
of a recognized DjVu document in your web browser
should automatically invoke the DjVu browser plugin.
Each browser uses different methods to determine that a particular
.SM URL
is in fact a DjVu document.
Web server normally provide a
.SM MIME
type to web browsers.
The official 
.SM MIME 
type for DjVu documents is
.BR image/vnd.djvu .
For compatibility with ancient versions of the
DjVu viewer, it is common to use instead the
experimental 
.SM MIME 
type
.B image/x-djvu
or
.BR image/x.djvu .
Web servers should be configured to send the 
proper
.SM MIME 
type for DjVu documents. 
Most web browsers also recognize files ending with
.B .djvu
or
.B .djv
as DjVu files.

An easy way to check if an http server is giving an appropriate
content-type is to invoke the following command with a 
.SM URL
corresponding to an actual DjVu file on the server.
.IP "" 2
.BI "curl -u " URL " | grep Content-Type"
.PP
The result should be one of the following, preferably the first.
.IP "" 2
.B Content-Type: image/vnd.djvu
.br
.B Content-Type: image/x.djvu
.br
.B Content-Type: image/x-djvu
.PP
Any other 
.SM MIME 
type indicates a server misconfiguration.


.SH CGI-STYLE FLAGS
The behavior of the DjVu browser plugin can be specified by
by augmenting the
.SM URL
using a syntax similar to that used by the
.SM CGI
programs.
This syntax is described by the following template:
.IP "" 3
.BI "http://.../file.djvu?djvuopts&" "keyword=value" "&" "keyword=value" "&" "..."
.PP
The DjVu browser plugin only recognizes keywords that appear
after the word
.BR djvuopts .
The keywords recognized by each viewer
are listed in the man pages for
.BR djview3 (1)
and
.BR djview4 (1)
Unrecognized keywords are ignored.
The most common keywords are:
.TP
.BI page= pagenum_or_pagename
Specify the initial page to be displayed.
Page numbers are numbered from 1.
.TP
.BI zoom= zoomfactor
Specify the initial zoom factor.
Legal values for
.I zoomfactor
are shown in the below:
.br
.TS
center,box;
lfI l
lfB l
lfB l
lfB l
lfB l
.
number	Magnification factor in range 10% to 999%.
one2one	Select the "one-to-one" mode.
width	Select the "fit width" mode.
page	Select the "fit page" mode.
stretch	Stretch the image to the plugin window size.

.SH EMBEDDING DJVU IMAGES IN HTML PAGES
You can integrate DjVu content on an
.SM HTML
web page with the
.SM <embed>
tag.
This method is that it will work even if your web 
server does not support the DjVu
.SM MIME
type.
The
.SM CGI
style flags can be directly used as attributes of the
embedding tag.
The following example shows the W3C standard syntax with the
.SM OBJECT 
tag:
.IP "" 3
.B "<object data=""myfile.djvu"" type=""image/x-djvu"""
.br
.B "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0 width=""100%"" height=""100%"" >"
.br
.B "\0\0\0 <param name=""page"" value=""iii"">"
.br
.B "\0\0\0 <param name=""zoom"" value=""stretch"">"
.br
.B "\0\0\0 This browser cannot render djvu data."
.br
.B "</object>"
.PP
And this is the customary syntax with the
.SM EMBED
tag:
.IP "" 3
.B "<embed src=""myfile.djvu"" type=""image/x-djvu"""
.br
.B "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0 width=""100%"" height=""100%"""
.br
.B "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0 page=""iii"" zoom=""stretch""></embed>"
.PP

.SH BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
The DjVu browser plugin has been tested with
several popular web browsers:
.SS NETSCAPE 4
.PP
The DjVu browser plugin is normally installed in directory
.BR /usr/local/lib/netscape/plugins .
This is sufficient to enable the DjVu browser plugin
because Netscape 4 always searches this directory for
plugins.
You might have to first remove previous version of the DjVuLibre plugin.
Selecting menu
.B "Help->About Plugins"
in
.B netscape
displays the current list of plugins.
Previous versions of the plugin might be installed in one of
the following locations:
.IP "" 2
.B "$HOME/.netscape/plugins/nsdejavu.so"
.br
.B "/usr/lib/netscape/plugins/nsdejavu.so"
.br
.B "/opt/netscape/plugins/nsdejavu.so"
.PP
More complicated cases can be solved by creating a symbolic
link into your personal plugin directory:
.IP "" 2
.B "cd $HOME/.netscape/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s /usr/lib/netscape/plugins/nsdejavu.so ."
.PP
You must not copy
.B nsdejavu.so
but create a symbolic link.  This is necessary
because
.B nsdejavu.so
first locates its normal installation directory by following the symbolic
link.  The Netscape plugin search rules are explained in the
.B README
file that comes with the Netscape distribution.
Also check option
.B -fix
of program
.BR djview3 .
.PP
.SS NETSCAPE 6
.PP
The DjVuLibre plugin works nicely with Netscape 6.1 or better.
It seems that Netscape 6 only recognize plugins installed inside
its own plugin directory.  This can be done using a symbolic link.
Let us assume that Netscape 6 is installed in
.IR /usr/local/netscape6 .
The following commands should do the trick:
.IP "" 2
.BI "cd " "/usr/local/netscape6" "/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s /usr/lib/netscape/plugins/nsdejavu.so ."
.PP
.SS MOZILLA
.PP
The DjVuLibre plugin works nicely with Mozilla 0.9.5 or better.
You must establish a link from the Mozilla plugin directory.
Assuming that Mozilla is installed under
.IR /usr/lib/mozilla-1.1 :
.IP "" 2
.BI "cd " "/usr/lib/mozilla-1.1" "/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s /usr/lib/netscape/plugins/nsdejavu.so ."
.PP
You can then restart
.B mozilla
and select menu
.B "Help->About Plugins" to check
whether the DjVuLibre plugin is properly recognized.
.PP
.SS GALEON
.PP
Galeon internally uses the Mozilla rendering engine.
Install the plugin for Mozilla and it should also
work for Galeon.
.PP
.SS FIREFOX
.PP
The DjVuLibre plugin works nicely with Firefox or better.
You must establish a link from the Firefox plugin directory.
Assuming that Firefox is installed under
.IR /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox :
.IP "" 2
.BI "cd " "/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox" "/plugins"
.br
.B "ln -s /usr/lib/netscape/plugins/nsdejavu.so ."
.PP
.SS KONQUEROR
.PP
The DjVuLibre plugin works with
.SM KDE-2.2
or better.
You must first make sure that
.B konqueror
recognizes the DjVU plugin.
In Konqueror, select
.BR "Settings->Configure Konqueror" .
When the dialog appears, select the icon
.BR "Netscape Plugins" .
Make sure that directory
.B "/usr/lib/netscape/plugins"
appears in the list of plugin directories.
Then press button
.BR "Scan for new plugins" .
Clicking the
.B "Plugins"
tab button should display a list of recognized plugins.
Check that
.B "nsdejavu.so"
appears there.
.PP
.SS OPERA
.PP
The DjVuLibre plugin works with Opera-6.
As explained in the Opera software support pages,
you must have the OpenMotif libraries installed.
