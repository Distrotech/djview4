This directory contains an experimental portable plugin dll 
partially based on the Qt solution qtbrowserplugin.
You need to compile with --enable-npdjvu to compile this.

Warning: This plugin does not work with konqueror
or Qt based browsers because of symbol conflicts
between the Qt library used by the browser
and the Qt library used by the plugin.
Static compilation would fix that at the expense
of considerable bloat.

The mac version does not work because the Qt solution
file is based on the deprecated Carbon interface,
whereas modern Qt versions are based on Coca.

---------------------------------------------------------

The following files are slightly modified variants 
of the qt browserplugin solution files:

  qtbrowserplugin.h
  qtbrowserplugin_p.h
  qtbrowserplugin_mac.cpp  (does not work)
  qtbrowserplugin_x11.cpp
  qtbrowserplugin_win.cpp
  qtbrowserplugin.def
  qtnpapi.h
  qtnpapi.cpp

These are the main files:
  npdjvu.h
  npdjvu.cpp
