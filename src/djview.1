.SH NAME
djview4 \- Standalone DjVu viewer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "djview4 [" "options" "] [" "argument" "]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Standalone viewer for DjVu files.  
Features include navigating documents,
zooming and panning page images, 
producing and displaying thumbnails,
displaying document outlines,
searching documents for particular words in the hidden text layer,
copying hidden text to the clipboard,
saving pages and documents
as bundled or indirect multi-page files, 
and printing page and documents.
The viewer can simultaneously display several pages
using a side-by-side or a continuous layout.

.SH COMMAND LINE ARGUMENT AND OPTIONS
This program
can run as a standalone program or 
as a slave process for the DjVu browser plugin
.BR nsdejavu .
When running as a standalone program,
the command line argument
.I argument
can be:
.IP "*" 3
The filename of a valid DjVu document.
.IP "*" 3
A local DjVu document 
.SM URL
of the form:
.IP "" 5
.BI "file:///" path "/" name.djvu "[?djvuopts&" keyword = value "&...]"
.IP "" 3
The square brackets delimit the optional components of the 
.SM URL.
Various options can be specified using a syntax
similar to that of
.SM CGI
arguments.
Specifying options in this manner is very useful 
for a browser plugin because there are no 
command line arguments.
In the case of a standalone viewer,
all options can be specified as command line arguments.
.IP "*" 3
An remote DjVu document 
.SM URL
of the form:
.IP "" 5
.BI http:// host / path "/" name.djvu "[?djvuopts&" keyword = value "&...]"
.IP "" 3
Browsing remote DjVu documents with the standalone viewer
is less efficient than using the browser plugin.
The standalone viewer does not benefit from the browser
caching strategies and proxy settings.
Proxy settings for the standalone viewer can be set
independently with the preferences dialog.
.PP

An extensive list of options are recognized.
Most options can be specified as command line argument starting
with the customary dash character
.BR "" "(" "-" ")"
or using the syntax of
.SM CGI
arguments in the document 
.SM URL.
Some options however are only meaningful 
as command line arguments.
Other options are only recognized when
running the 
.SM X11
version of the 
.BR djview4
program.

.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
The following options are only meaningful
when specified on the command line.

.TP
.B "-help"
Display a brief help message.

.TP
.B "-verbose"
Prints informational messages on the console.
This option is very useful because it displays
messages about the unrecognized constructs
in the DjVu annotation and hyperlink layers.

.TP
.BI "-fullscreen, -fs "
Start 
.B djview4 
in full screen mode.
Use the key
.B F11
to exit the full screen mode.

.TP
.BI "-style=" "stylename"
Specify the graphical user interface style.
The recognized values for
.I stylename
depend on the installed version of the Qt toolkit.
Common style names include
.BR cde ,
.BR motif ,
.BR plastique ,
.BR platinum ,
and
.BR windows .


.SH X11 OPTIONS
The following command line options are recognized by the
.SM X11
version of the 
.B djview4
program.
Unlike most 
.B djview4 options, 
X11 options that demand an argument
do not use the equal character 
to introduce their argument.
.TP
.BI "-display " "displayname"
Specify that the 
.B djview4
windows should appear on the X11 display 
.IR displayname .

.TP
.BI "-geometry " W x H + X + Y
Specify the initial size and position of the first window
using the traditional X11 geometry specification syntax.
The numerical arguments 
.IR W " and " H
represent the initial window width and height.
The numerical arguments 
.IR X " and " Y
indicate the window position relative to the 
top left corner of the screen.

.TP
.BI "-name " "name"
Set the application name.

.TP
.BI "-title " "title"
Set the title of the first window.

.TP
.BI "-fn " "fontname" ", -font " "fontname"
Specify the name of the default font 
used for buttons and menus.
The font should be specified using 
a X logical font description string.
.TP
.BI "-bg " "color" ", -background " "color"
Specify the default background color for 
graphical user interface elements.
The color should be given as a standard X11 color name.

.TP
.BI "-fg " "color" ", -foreground " "color"
Specify the default foreground color for 
graphical user interface elements.
The color should be given as a standard X11 color name.

.TP
.BI "-btn " "color"
Specify the default button color.
The color should be given as a standard X11 color name.

.TP
.BI "-ncols " "count"
Limit the number of colors allocated on a 8 bit display. 
The default color cube contains 216 distinct colors.
.TP
.B "-cmap"
Force the allocation of a private color map on a 8-bit display.
This might increase the color quality but cause flashing
when the viewer window gets activated.

.SH GENERAL OPTIONS
The following options can be specified as command line options
or can be passed by augmenting the document 
.SM URL
using a syntax similar to that of
.SM CGI
arguments
.IP "" 3
.BI "http://.../file.djvu?djvuopts&" "key=value" "&" "key=value" "&" "..."
.PP
In order to separate real
.SM CGI 
arguments from these options,
the viewer only recognizes keywords 
that appear after the word
.BR djvuopts .
The keywords
.I key
are derived from the option names 
by removing the initial dashes. 

.TP
.BI "-page=" "pagename"
Display a specific document page.
The viewer first searches a page 
whose identifier matches the argument
.IR pagename .
Otherwise, if 
.I pagename
if a number preceded by character 
.BR "+" " or " "-" ","
the viewer performs a displacement relative to the current page.
Otherwise, starting from the current page
and wrapping around, it searches for a page
whose title matches the argument
.IR pagename .
Otherwise, if 
.I pagename
is numerical, it is interpreted as 
an ordinal page number.
Otherwise, and finally, the viewer searches a page
whose name matches
.IR pagename .
.TP
.BI "-pageno=" "pagenumber"
The page searching algorithm for option
.B "page"
can cause ambiguities when page titles can
be interpreted as numbers.
The argument of option
.B "pageno"
is always interpreted as an ordinal page number.
This option is less portable than
.B "page"
because it is not recognized by earlier 
versions of the djvu plugin. 
When using this option is necessary,
it is advisable to use both the
.B "page" 
and 
.B "pageno"
options.
.TP
.BI "-zoom=" zoomfactor
Specify the initial zoom factor.
Unless the toolbar, pop-up menu and keyboard are disabled,
the user will be able to change the zoom factor.
