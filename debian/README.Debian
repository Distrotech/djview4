djview4 for Debian
-----------------

The nsdejavu stuff is ignored, since the one distributed with
djvulibre works as well.

The Debian CVS repository is shared with upstream.
 cvs -d :ext:UID@djvu.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/djvu checkout djview
This makes the appropriate build command something like
 cvs-buildpackage -U release_4_5 -M djview -F
