This cvs repository contains a QT4 djvu viewer under development.
It is intended to replace the djview program in djvulibre-3.5.
It depends only on the public djvulibre api ddjvuapi.h and miniexp.h.

Go into directory src.
Check the qt4 program names in Makefile.
Compile and run.

At this point:

- Key F1 toggles side-by-side display
- Key F2 toggles continuous display
- Keys + and - change the zoom factor
- Keys [ and ] rotate the pages
- Keys < and > go one page backward or forward

and a few others for you to discover.
