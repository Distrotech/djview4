HOW TO CREATE NEW TRANSLATION FILES FOR DJVIEW.
-----------------------------------------------


- Determine the language code for your language.
  Sometimes language codes have suffixes in capital letters
  for describing variants. But we always use lowercase.
  For instance, use 'zh_cn' or 'zh_tw' for the two variants of chinese. 
  In the following explanation we assume 'de' for german.

- Go to directory 'src'
        $ cd src

- Add the following line into file 'djview.pro'
        TRANSLATIONS += djview_de.ts 

- Run the Qt program 'lupdate'
        $ lupdate djview.pro

- A file named djview_de.ts must have been created.
  You must edit the translations using the Qt program 'linguist'.
        $ linguist djview_de.ts
  See the linguist documentation in the Qt documentation.
  Alternatively you can use 'kbabel' to edit the ts file.

- Run the Qt program 'lrelease'
        $ lrelease djview.pro

- You should have now a file named 'djview_de.qm'.
  To test your translations, type
        $ LANGUAGE=de ./djview

- Once you are satisfied, 
  send me your translation file 
  by email (leonb@users.sourceforge.net)


Thanks.
