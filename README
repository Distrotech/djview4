This cvs repository contains a QT4 djvu viewer under development.
It is intended to replace the djview program in djvulibre-3.5.
It depends only on the public djvulibre api ddjvuapi.h and miniexp.h.


Prerequisites
- Qt-4.1
- djvulibre-3.5.18  (or pre18, latest CVS version)

Compiling
$ cd djview/src
$ qmake-qt4
$ make
$ ./djview filename

Using it as a plugin.
- Assuming you already have the djvulibre-3.5 plugin working,
  the following trick makes it call this version of djview
  instead of the default one.

$ export NPX_DJVIEW=`pwd`/djview
$ firefox


Hightlights:
- entirely based on the public library api (ddjvuapi)
- continuous scrolling of pages
- side-by-side display of pages
- ability to specify a url to the djview command
- all plugin and cgi options available from the command line
- all silly annotations implemented
- display thumbnails as a grid
- display outlines
- page names supported (see djvused command set-page-title) 
- metadata dialog (see djvused command set-meta)
- implemented as reusable Qt widgets

Todo before 1st release.
- find functionality
- print dialog
- preference dialog

Welcome help
- translation files

Ideas for later releases.
- animation hints when jumping to specific locations
- saving djvu documents as indirect files.
- export dialog
