This directory contains an experimental portable plugin dll 
partially based on the Qt solution qtbrowserplugin.
You need to compile with --enable-npdjvu to compile this.

Warning: This plugin does not work with konqueror
or Qt based browsers because of symbol conflicts
between the Qt library used by the browser
and the Qt library used by the plugin.
Static compilation would fix that at the expense
of considerable bloat.


---------------------------------------------------------

The following files are the genuine qt solution files:
  qtbrowserplugin_mac.cpp  (does not work)
  qtbrowserplugin_x11.cpp
  qtbrowserplugin_win.cpp
  qtbrowserplugin.def
  qtnpapi.h

This files is a slightly modified qt solution file:
  qtbrowserplugin_p.h

These files are derived from the qt solution code:
  qtbrowserplugin.h
  qtnpapi.cpp

This is the main file:
  npdjvu.cpp
