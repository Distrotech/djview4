This cvs repository contains a QT4 djvu viewer under development.
It is intended to replace the djview program in djvulibre-3.5.
It depends only on the public djvulibre api ddjvuapi.h and miniexp.h.

Go directory src.
Use qmake (qt4) to generate a makefile.
Compile and run.
Many features are still missing....
